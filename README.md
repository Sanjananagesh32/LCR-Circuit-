This project demonstrates the design and simulation of Series and Parallel LCR (Inductor-Capacitor-Resistor) circuits. It includes circuit diagrams, explanations, and analysis of voltage, current, and phase behavior using simulation tools and basic circuit theory.

⟩ LCR Circuit – Overview
An LCR circuit is an electrical circuit consisting of three basic components:
L – Inductor
C – Capacitor
R – Resistor 
These components are combined to form circuits that respond differently depending on their configuration series or parallel.

⟩ LCR circuit uses 
LCR circuits are widely used in various electronic and electrical systems, including:
1. Computers and microprocessors – for signal timing and filtering
2. Radios and televisions – in tuning and frequency selection
3. Audio devices – for sound filtering and crossover networks
4. Power systems – to correct power factor and manage energy loss
5. Medical devices – for accurate signal processing (e.g., ECG, EEG)
6. Communication systems – to isolate or pass desired frequencies

⟩ Project Details
This project includes the design and simulation of both:

1. Series LCR Circuit
» Components are connected one after the other in a single loop
» Commonly used in resonant circuits and time-delay networks
» Helps in precise signal tuning and filtering

2. Parallel LCR Circuit
» Components are connected across the same two points
» Used for voltage regulation, frequency selection, and impedance matching
» Effective in RF and antenna systems
